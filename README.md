Browser extension allows customers to mark link to to-do lists 🌐🔖

## Inspiration

When I browse through technical documentation or do exercises on websites, I come across important content that I want to remember. However, after a few days, I may forget about this content and neglect to remind myself to review it. For instance, when solving problems on Leetcode, I often want to remind myself to revisit a problem the next day after completing it, but there is a high probability that I will forget to do so 😢.

Therefore, the purpose of Marktodo is to allow you to mark these important pieces of content and remind yourself to review them after a certain period of time.
